# Evaluation Metrics for Regression

Evaluating a regression model helps us understand how well the model is performing.

## Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Measures average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
- Less sensitive to outliers.

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Squares the errors before averaging.
- Penalizes large errors more heavily.

## Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Square root of MSE.
- Interpretable in the same units as the target variable.

## R² Score
- Represents how much variance in the target variable is explained by the model.
- Value ranges from 0 to 1.

## Why Multiple Metrics?
Using multiple metrics provides a more reliable evaluation of model performance.
