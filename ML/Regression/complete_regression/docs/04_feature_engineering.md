# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance.

## Handling Missing Values
Missing values can negatively impact model training and evaluation.
Common strategies:
- Mean / Median imputation
- Mode imputation for categorical data

## Encoding Categorical Variables
Machine learning models require numerical input.
Categorical variables are converted using:
- Label Encoding
- One-Hot Encoding

## Feature Scaling
Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model.
Common techniques:
- Standard Scaling
- Min-Max Scaling

## Feature Transformation
Used to handle skewed data:
- Log transformation
- Square root transformation

Feature engineering plays a critical role in improving regression model accuracy.
