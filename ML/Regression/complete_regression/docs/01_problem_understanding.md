# Problem Understanding

## What is the Problem?
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various demographic and geographical features.

This is a **supervised learning** problem because the target variable is known, and it is a **regression problem** because the output is a continuous numerical value.

## Why is this Problem Important?
House price prediction is widely used in:
- Real estate valuation
- Financial risk analysis
- Urban planning
- Investment decision making

## Input Features
The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features such as:
- Location details
- Population statistics
- Housing characteristics

## Target Variable
- `median_house_value`: Represents the median house price for a given area.

## Type of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Regression
