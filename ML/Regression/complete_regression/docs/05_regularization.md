# Regularization Techniques

Regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large model coefficients.

## Why Regularization is Needed
- Reduces model complexity
- Improves generalization
- Handles multicollinearity

## Ridge Regression (L2)
- Adds squared penalty to coefficients
- Reduces coefficient magnitude
- Keeps all features

## Lasso Regression (L1)
- Adds absolute penalty
- Can reduce coefficients to zero
- Performs feature selection

## ElasticNet Regression
- Combination of Ridge and Lasso
- Useful when features are correlated

Regularization is an essential technique in real-world machine learning systems.
