ML ROADMAP

LAYER 1: FOUNDATIONS (NO ML YET)

Purpose: Understand what problem ML solves

Learn in this order:
1. What is Machine Learning
2. Types of ML
   - Supervised Learning
   - Unsupervised Learning
   - Semi-supervised Learning
3. Machine Learning workflow

Machine Learning Flow (memorize this):
Problem → Data → Cleaning → Features → Model → Evaluation → Improvement

Do NOT learn algorithms here.

--------------------------------------------------

LAYER 2: DATA UNDERSTANDING & PREPROCESSING

Purpose: ML is 80% data, not algorithms

Learn in this order:
1. Dataset types
   - Structured
   - Unstructured
2. Features and Target
   - X (input)
   - y (output)
3. Data issues
   - Missing values
   - Outliers
   - Duplicates
4. Encoding (this is where encoding belongs)
   - Label Encoding
   - One-Hot Encoding
5. Feature Scaling
   - Standardization
   - Normalization
6. Train-test split

After this step, your data is ML-ready.

--------------------------------------------------

LAYER 3: SUPERVISED LEARNING (CORE ML)

Purpose: Learn how models think

STEP 1: REGRESSION (always start here)

Learn in this order:
1. Linear Regression
2. Cost Function (MSE)
3. Gradient Descent (intuition only)
4. Overfitting vs Underfitting

Regression Metrics:
- MAE
- MSE
- RMSE
- R-squared

Metrics only make sense AFTER training a model.

--------------------------------------------------

STEP 2: CLASSIFICATION

Learn in this order:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest (intuition)

Classification Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC

Why accuracy fails:
Accuracy fails when data is imbalanced.
Precision and Recall solve this problem.

--------------------------------------------------

LAYER 4: MODEL EVALUATION & IMPROVEMENT

This layer causes maximum confusion.

Learn in this order:
1. Why evaluation is needed
2. Confusion Matrix (most important)
3. Choosing the correct metric
4. Cross-validation
5. Bias-variance tradeoff
6. Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch / RandomSearch)

Golden Rule:
A model is not good just because accuracy is high.
A model is good if it generalizes well.

--------------------------------------------------

LAYER 5: UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

Purpose: Find patterns without labels

Learn:
1. K-Means Clustering
2. Elbow Method
3. Hierarchical Clustering
4. PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)

Unsupervised Metrics:
- Silhouette Score
- Inertia
